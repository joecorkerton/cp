Began exercise by writing code which calculates B field around a single coil of current I. Implemented this by splitting loop up into N line segments, and calculated the field from each segment using biot savart law. Compared results with analytic results for axial field on axis of the coil, found results agreed well with data, and increasing N by an order of magnitude gave results ~ 2 orders of magnitude more accuracy.

Now added in another coil, putting their centres at +- (R/2,0,0) respectively, where radius R = 1m. Found that field is highly uniform inside the coils, close to the origin. Within a cylinder of 10cm maximum percentage deviation from B at the origin was 0.007%. Field pattern followed what I would expect for a pair of coils, but of note is that the values of B weren't quite symmetric about the axes, particularly noticable far away from the coils. I assume this is due to errors from the method of calculating the integral, but I was unable to confirm this.

Finally I investigated the field patterns when one of the currents is reversed. This led to the field being strongly replled along the plane x = 0, as opposing directions 'collide'. This generates field lines which encircle the coils. The field is still very uniform away from the origin but within the coils. All of this would be expected on the grounds of physical intuition.
