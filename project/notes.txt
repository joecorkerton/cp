Starting from all up state, no random selection, large number of iterations (1E5):
	Magnetisation:
	-Very High T (1E7+) unstable, flips between +1 (max) and -1 (min) on alternate cycles, as spins always flip. Can average over multiple cycles to give <M> = 0
	-High T (1E5) oscillates between +0.2 and -0.2, still averages to 0
	-T = 1E3 still 'flipping' but not constant, amplitude changes in 'chunks'. Averages to 0 to 2 d.p.
	-T = 1E1 more chaotic small scale behaviour, average is very close to 0 still
	-T = 1E0 average value varies slightly but still almost 1
	-T = 1E-1 & 1E-2 & -3 stable constant at M = 1, no spins have the energy to flip
	-T = 5, averages to 0. T = 2 seems to be the most volatile for <M> after averaging over 1E3 steps. spins have enough energy to frequently flip the entire orientation of the system
	and create varying averages.
	
	VERY SENSITIVE TO TEMP
	larger N means less volatile
	
	from simple variation of magnetisation with temp, find critical temp occurs at roughly Tc = 2.25 J/k_B. COMPARE WITH ANALYTIC RESULT 
	energy seems to just increase with higher T (as expected). No noticable sharp transition though.
	
	--------------------------------------------------------------------
	rewrote code to reach equilibrium then calculate averages, think this is a lot better
	
	Tc systematically above expected value - finite size scaling
	
	Tc results done with j = 2.5E3, N = 100
	
	finite size scaling done with j = 5E4
	
	Linear regression on graph f(x) = ax + b, gives a = 4.2 +- 0.3, b = 2.332 +- 0.005
	
	comment on domain size, sharply increases below Tc. Small above Tc
	
	Create more gifs if I have time
	
	When an external field is applied, spins have a preferred direction and large domains are not formed at Tc anymore
