Managed to simulate a simple pendulum of unit mass and of length l = g using gsl_odeiv2. Plotted theta and d(theta)/dt against time for 1000 oscillations for a small initial displacement and got sin(wt) or cos(wt) as expected. Investigated how well solution conserved energy, found it doesn't conserve energy as well as I would expect, with 0.5% change after 10,000 oscillations. Plotted how period varies with initial displacement theta0, and found when theta0 = pi/2, T =  7.4144 s

Turned on damping (q) and found that system behaved as expected; underdamped for q = 1, close to critical damping for q = 5 and overdamped for q = 10.

Now setting q = 0.5 and also turning on driving force (F), for a small force (F = 0.5) the period of the oscillations matches the period of the forced oscillations (3*pi s in this case). Of note is that for very large values of theta0, the simulation breaks and gives a period of -nan, caused due to the pendulum going 'over the top'.

For larger values of F (F = 1.44, 1.465), the program can't handle the fact that the pendulum is going past theta = pi, and the solutions stop making physical sense; the amplitude continues to decrease. For F = 1.2 we get wildly varying behaviour, with some sinusoidal trend, though it diverges for large t.
